# Q-learning Demo

This demo notebook file `demo.ipynb` is basically identical to this [article](https://www.samyzaf.com/ML/rl/qmaze.html).

Some code blocks have been rearranged and some comments have been added. A mdoel test section is also included to test out the pre-trained model.

Both `model.h5` and `model.json` are model files, which logs the weight of pre-trained model. We can load them to our empty model. Both files are essentially same, so just use one you like.
