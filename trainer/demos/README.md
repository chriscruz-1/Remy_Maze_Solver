# Q-learning Demo

This demo notebook file `demo.ipynb` is basically identical to this [article](https://www.samyzaf.com/ML/rl/qmaze.html).

Some code blocks have been rearranged and some comments have been added. A mdoel test section is also included to test out the pre-trained model.

Both `model.h5` and `model.json` are model files, which logs the weight of pre-trained model. We can load them to our empty model. 

- For python project, please use file with extension `.h5` to load weight into models. 
- For web project, namely JavaScript project, please use file with extension `.json` to load weight. The doc for loading model with JS is [here.](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/tutorials/conversion/import_keras)
