# Web App for Maze Solver

## Prerequisite

Install the latest Django by running the following code, if there is further issue, please refer to [this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/install/).

``` bash
python3 -m pip install Django
```

*For MacOS, you probably want to use pip3 instead of pip.*

## How to deploy

- cd to folder which contains this `README.md` file which you are reading.
- run `python3 manage.py runserver` to launch the web app.

## For VS Code User

A workspace has been created, if you are using vs code, you can directly open the `maze-ws.code-workspace` file using vs code. A default debug configuration has been correctly set. You still need to specify your local machine's interpreter location.
